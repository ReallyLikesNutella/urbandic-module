# urbandic-module

Little bit of python for use with the Willie IRC bot @  http://willie.dftba.net/ & https://github.com/embolalia/willie

# What does it do?

Simply, throw a word at it using the .ud command and you'll get the top defintion back from http://www.urbandictionary.com/

## But whyyyy?

This was knocked together to help the yanks understand the brits in #crude on irc.freenode.net. Getme bruv.

# How to install?

1. Clone the python module to the modules folder for your willie install. This will usally be `/home/YOURUSERNAME/.willie`
2. Make sure your `default.cfg` file (Same dir) contains the line `extra = /home/YOURUSERNAME/.willie/modules`
